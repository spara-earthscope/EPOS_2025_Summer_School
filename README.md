# Examples for Accessing EarthScope Data

This notebook contains code examples for accessing SAGE and GAGE repositories. It covers commandline tools and webservices. It also includes an example for working with data in AWS S3.

This repository uses [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) as a package manager. To run this repository locally, run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
``` 

Alternatively, you can use pip to install dependencies, but it is not guaranteed to work.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run locaally:

```
jupyter lab
```

This will open a jupyter lab instance in a browser window.
